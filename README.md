<h1>Open Source Lunch</h1>
<p>Thank an open source developer by buying him lunch. Use this tool to explore Github users local to your region.</p>
<p>The live demo requires HTTPS for the geo location api to work, however, I don't have an SSL cert on my domain yet: <a href="https://stuartzahn.net/open-source-lunch/#">https://stuartzahn.net/open-source-lunch/#</a></p>
<p>Feel free to fork or clone it and host it locally to explore local users.</p>
